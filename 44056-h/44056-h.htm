  <p>Allow me, in dedicating this volume of Illustrations to you, to evince my respect and
  friendship for one whose talents shun publicity. It may have a beneficial influence on the rising
  generation, to know, that a highly cultivated understanding, and varied accomplishments, are not
  inconsistent with a perfect discharge of all the social duties. And that a mind stored with
  knowledge, and imbued with Religion, is an effectual antidote to the cheerless influence of
  debilitated health.</p>

  <p>That these, my Zoological <i>Recreations</i>, may in your opinion, contribute to the great end
  which the naturalist should ever keep in view, the developement of the harmonies of Creation, and
  the discovery of the natural system, is the hope of,</p>

  <p>The execution of the Zoological drawings now published, have been to us an agreeable relaxation
  from severer studies; and the concise descriptions by which they are accompanied, are intended to
  convey, in a condensed and popular form, the partial result of more extended investigations.
  Species are the objects of which the whole fabric of animated nature is composed, and their
  respective properties must be investigated, before their natural combinations can be understood.
  Their delineation is therefore highly important. Figures bring before us objects which cannot
  always be understood by words; while if faithfully executed, they possess the same value as every
  period of time; for nature is unchangeable.</p>

  <p>It is to be regretted that of late much discussion should have arisen among our own
  naturalists, as to the relative merits of the different modes by which they study nature. The
  searchers after the natural system throwing obloquy on those who investigate species,<a id="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> while the latter contend that mankind is more interested in
  knowing the properties of species, than those of groups.<a id="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> To us it appears that such discussions are unnecessary, and but
  ill calculated to promote that good feeling which should prevail in a division of labour. The
  power of embracing comprehensive views, and of detecting diversified relations, must be confined
  to a few, because such objects require the greatest exertion of a superior mind, yet they must
  ever be mainly dependant on the labours of another class of naturalists: those who analyze the
  properties of species, and <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'seperate'.">separate</span> with critical judgment, and nice
  discrimination, resemblances from affinities. But for these valuable coadjutors our acquaintance
  with nature would be altogether speculative: they supply, in short, by analysis, that basis upon
  which all true knowledge of nature must repose. Natural combinations can never be fully detected,
  without an acquaintance with their component parts.</p>

  <p>The investigator of general laws, and the discriminator of species, are thus advancing the
  knowledge of their favourite science by different modes of study. The paths they have chosen,
  although essentially distinct, lead but to one common point; and as both must be trodden, it seems
  unnecessary to discuss which road is the most honourable.</p>

  <p>In the classification of the subjects here comprised, we have followed no particular system:
  the chief object aimed at, being to point out apparent relations and affinities. To those
  Ornithological groups which Linneus named Genera, and which subsequent systematists have
  considered Families or sub-families, we have applied the designations long used by Leach, Stevens,
  Fleming, Vigors, &amp;c., but in all cases where such divisions are unaccompanied by a definition,
  (in the following pages,) we wish it to be understood, that the name is merely applied
  <i>provisionally</i>; indicating the <i>probable</i> station of the individual; and that in very
  few instances do our own opinions on the nature of such groups, coincide with those of the
  different writers who have gone before us.</p>

  <p>The splendid discovery of the circular system of Nature, has given a totally new aspect to this
  science; but has nevertheless been attended with an evil, no where more apparent than in
  Ornithology; where synthesis has completely set aside analysis, and where the rugged and laborious
  path of patient investigation, has been deserted for the flowery walks of Speculation and <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'Hypothosis'.">Hypothesis</span>. The combinations thus
  produced, may well excite the smile of our continental neighbours, nor need we feel surprise that
  they look, with something like contempt, on such arrangements "called natural" of affinities and
  relations.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the Ornithological writings of Sonnini, Le Vaillant, Wilson, and Azara, are
  never failing sources of information to the searcher after truth. The observations of such men,
  who recorded Nature as she really is, and who cared very little for the fashionable systems of the
  day, may be for a time neglected: but they must finally assume that importance which is ever
  attached to unbiassed and disinterested testimony. To this honourable list our own country can
  furnish other names. The habits and economy of our native birds have been accurately and patiently
  investigated by those lyncean naturalists, White, Montague, and Selby, while their internal
  structure is now engaging the attention of Mr. Yarrell, a Gentleman eminently qualified by long
  study, and matured reflection, for such a task.</p>

  <p>In Conchology we have been more desirous to illustrate groups, than species; the latter will be
  done, on a very extensive scale, in the forthcoming work of Mess. Sowerby.</p>

  <p>From the patient labours, and cautious deductions, of Dr. Horsfield, we expect a more perfect
  elucidation of the Lepidopterous Insects than has yet, perhaps, been attempted. As this will be
  the result of careful analysis, we shall place a high degree of confidence in the views it may
  develope.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, it may be as well to add, that our views on several of the higher groups, here
  but slightly noticed, will be more fully explained in another work, now preparing for
  Publication.</p>

  <p>The Vernal Parrakeet has hitherto remained unfigured, except in the scarce and little known
  work of Sparman: nor was its native country ascertained, until recent travellers discovered it in
  the islands of Java and Teinor.</p>

  <p>This is one of the smallest of parrots, scarcely exceeding five inches in length; the feathers
  of the head have a silky texture, and their colour, in some lights, is particularly vivid: the
  tail and the wings are green above, but of a rich deep blue beneath; a character said to be
  equally conspicuous in P. <i>galgulus</i> L. The spot on the throat, in our specimen, is
  orange.</p>

  <p>In respect to the situation of this bird among its congeners, we retain it, provisionally, in
  the genus <i>Psittacula</i> of Brisson &amp; Kuhl, adopting the termination used by M. Spix, to
  avoid the alteration of specific names. We have not yet had leisure to study the new divisions
  made in this family, with that attention they deserve; but it strikes us, as a defect in the genus
  <i>Psittaculus</i>, that it unites birds of the Old and the New World in one group. Except in
  their size, no two parrots can be more dissimilar in construction than the Indian P.
  <i>vernalis</i>, and the American P. <i>passerinus</i>. In the first, the under mandible is
  smallest, narrow, and rather pointed; the first quill longest; and the tail feathers rounded. In
  P. <i>passerinus</i>, the under mandible is largest, high, very thick, and quite obtuse; the
  second quill longest, and the tail feathers acutely pointed. These may be usefully employed as
  sectional characters, until the contents of the two groups are better understood.</p>

  <p>The whole extent of Tropical America, from Mexico to the banks of the Rio Plata, is inhabited
  by this majestic bird. It has been slightly noticed by the earlier writers, but nothing was known
  of its history, until the publication of the invaluable Memoirs of Azara.</p>

  <p>Its length is about twenty-one inches. In its habits there is a mixture of cowardice and
  daring. It will attack all other rapacious birds, excepting eagles, for the purpose of robbing
  them of their prey, and will often seize the game of the hunter, before he has time to secure it.
  Yet the Caracara is frequently driven from its haunts by the courage of small birds; and will only
  attack young chickens when not defended by their mother.</p>

  <p>The birds which form the modern genera of <i>Daptrius</i>, <i>Ibycter</i>, <i>Polyborus</i>,
  and <i>Milvago</i>, present so many characters in common, that we cannot consider them of
  sufficient rank to be called genera. They appear to us, taken collectively, to form one group, in
  which every species exhibits a peculiar modification of structure, assimilating either to the
  Vultures or the Falcons. Allied both in structure and manners to both these families, each bird
  may be considered as a strongly marked link of connexion. They present, in short, that interchange
  of characters, generally confined to individual species, which Nature invariably exhibits at the
  union of her more comprehensive groups.</p>

  <p>A specimen of this richly-coloured bird was sent to John Taylor, Esq., F. G. S., &amp;c., from
  Real del Monte, in Mexico. It is not only new to Ornithologists, but forms a beautiful addition to
  a geographic group, originally founded upon one species.</p>

  <p>The figure is the size of life. The bristles at the bill are compact, rigid, and all directed
  forwards: under tail covers and thighs whitish: the white band on the wings occupies the greater
  covers, and the tips of the lesser: the quill covers are also margined with white: the extreme
  base of the three outer tail feathers are more or less black.</p>

  <p>The characters upon which we formed this group, confine it strictly to birds of the New World.
  For although the habits of the typical species evince a marked affinity to the Fantailed
  Flycatchers of Australia, the construction of their wings is totally different. The disposition of
  the black and crimson colours on our bird, will remind the Ornithologist of the Red-bellied
  Flycatcher of Latham, of which, in fact, it is nearly an exact prototype. But this resemblance,
  however strong, appears to us to be one of analogy, rather than of affinity. We consequently
  consider the <i>Muscicapa Multicolor</i>, <i>Lathami</i>, and <i>Goodenovia</i>, of MM. Horsfield
  and Vigors, as more truly belonging to the family of <i>Sylviadæ</i>.</p>

  <p>The Ancillariæ are marine shells, few in number, and peculiar to warm latitudes. They are
  naturally polished, and very much shaped, like the Olives; but the suture, which in those shells
  is marked by a deep grove, is in these covered by a thick enamel. The animal, we believe, remains
  unknown. In a monograph of this genus, published in the Journal above quoted, we described
  fourteen recent, and four fossil species, being all which, at that period, we had seen. Of these,
  the present is one of the largest, and certainly the most beautiful. Our figure was made from a
  matchless specimen, received by Mrs. Mawe from China, and now in the collection of Mr.

  <p>The Jacanas are wading birds, somewhat analagous, both in structure and habits, to the European
  water-hen; but in their native haunts, from not being disturbed, they are less shy. The number of
  these birds on the lakes of Brazil, the elegance of their movements, and their fearlessness of
  man, excite an interest in the traveller who journeys through regions, ornamented alone by
  Nature.</p>

  <p>Most of the Jacanas inhabit South America&mdash;a few occur in India; and this, as its name
  implies, is found in Africa. The typical species have the wings armed with a strong and very acute
  bony spur; but in P. <i>Africana</i>, this is so small, as not to be perceived when the wing is
  closed.&mdash;Bruce mentions this bird by the name of Meylie, as inhabiting Abyssinia; and Mr.
  Salt found it at Mozambique. Our specimen was received from Western Africa, by Mr. Ward, Animal
  Preserver, Broad Street, Golden Square.</p>

  <p>The peculiar structure of the feet of these birds is highly singular, but their particular use
  has not, we believe, been explained. The Jacanas are very light birds; and their long toes,
  spreading over a wide surface, enable them to walk on the floating leaves of aquatic plants, with
  as much facility as if they were on land. In such situations their appearance is really delusive;
  for their pressure being sufficient to sink the supporting leaf just below the surface, the birds
  actually appear to walk upon the water.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cuculus</i>, even as now restricted, contains a number of species, dispersed over
  the continents and islands of the Old World. In America they are not known: but the genus
  <i>Coccyzus</i>, which there represents the group, is one of those few which are common to both
  hemispheres.</p>

  <p>The specific distinctions of birds having a uniform black plumage, is at all times difficult;
  and more so, when we attempt to identify them with the descriptions of authors. Of the black
  Cuckows of Africa, our bird comes nearest to the <i>Coucou criard</i> of Levaillant, (Ois. d'Af.
  pl. 204-5,) but differs in having the bill and feet black instead of yellow: it cannot be the
  <i>Cuculus Indicus niger</i> of Brisson, as <i>that</i> has the quills, internally, "tout à fait
  noir:" neither is it the black Indian Cuckow of Edwards, pl. 58, (<i>Cuculus niger</i> Lin.,)
  whose bill and feet are red. We were inclined to think that the second species of Buffon's
  <i>Coukeels</i> might be our bird, notwithstanding the difference of their locality; but
  Commerson's original description decides the question; his words are "<i>Cuculus cristatus
  mindanensis c&#x0153;ruleo nigricans totus</i>," (Buff. ed. Son. 54. p. 54.) Our bird has no
  crest. We have here consulted only original writers; for subsequent transcribers have so blended
  these birds under one name, that it is scarcely possible to disentangle their synonyms. M.
  Vieillot has increased the confusion, by transposing the specific names of Linnæus: the true <i>C.
  niger</i>, L. being his <i>Orientalis</i> (En. Meth. Orn. 1331).</p>

  <p>Our bird was sent to us for examination by Mr. Ward. It is a genuine Cuckow: the nostrils being
  round, the third quill longest, and the second shorter than the fourth. It came from Western
  Africa.</p>

  <p>A splendid specimen of this lovely bird (the only one we believe in this kingdom), came into
  our possession some years ago through Mr. Warwick, a travelling naturalist of great merit. It was
  purchased by him, alive, in the Isle of France, where it had been brought in a trading vessel from
  New Guinea: but it unfortunately died on its passage to England.</p>

  <p>We feel happy, that in recording this new and beautiful bird, an early opportunity is given us
  of commemorating our deep sense of the kindness we received from a young naturalist of France,
  whose writings have already acquired celebrity, and who promises to inherit the great and
  commanding talents of his illustrious father. In prosecuting our studies at the <i>Garden of
  Plants</i>, we met with such unexampled liberality from its most distinguished Professors, that we
  feel embarrassed where first to return our thanks. But the facilities and attentions we received
  from M. Isidore Geoffroy Saint Hilaire, partly involved a sacrifice of personal convenience;
  uncalled for, either by the nature of his appointment, or by the common rules of courtesy. So much
  for the reception which British naturalists receive in France. We should do well, when striving to
  imitate the Zoological Institutions of that nation, if we imbibed somewhat more of their
  liberality. We hope the time is not far distant, when the system of regulations and restrictions,
  which now fence the Museum of a popular Society, from all who cannot pay for admittance, as
  members, may be exchanged for a policy more creditable to the age, and more honourable to the
  nation.</p>

  <p>In the first Series of our Illustrations, we endeavoured to lessen the confusion which, at that
  time, prevailed among the species of Ampullaria, figuring and naming such as appeared to us truly
  distinct. During the course of our labours, the sixth part of the "<i><span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'Animanx'.">Animaux</span> sans Vetebres</i>" of the celebrated Lamarck was
  published in Paris; in which is described several species, figured in our volumes under other
  names. A want of mutual communication between authors writing at the same time, and on the same
  subject, has naturally caused confusion in nomenclature; which, at an early period, we intend to
  elucidate.</p>

  <p>Our friend the Rev. L. Guilding, whose accuracy of observation can only be equalled by his
  indefatigable zeal, has established the distinction between the horny and shelly operculated
  <i>Ampullariæ</i>, on anatomical principles. The present species (which was engraved before his
  valuable memoir was published) must consequently be placed in his genus <i>Pachystoma</i>; while
  the <i>carinata</i> of Lamarck, from having a horny operculum, remains with the true
  Ampullariæ.</p>

  <p>We know not the precise locality of our species; but conjecture it may be from some of the
  rivers of India.&mdash;Specimens, in different stages of growth, are in the Manchester Museum, and
  in our own.</p>

  <p>In our former Series, we have frequently mentioned the Fluviatile Bivalve Shells, of which the
  genus <i>Unio</i> appears to be the type. In a group which present so few certain characters,
  either for discriminating the species or characterizing the genera, we have, with other writers,
  held different opinions at different times. And the reader has only to peruse an interesting paper
  on these shells, in the Zoological Journal (Vol. I. p. 53), to be convinced of the intricacy of
  the subject.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless it is observed, by those who study natural affinities, that when the links between
  two distinct forms of animals are so complete, that their dissimilarities are lost in intermediate
  and undefinable gradations, it is then that the natural arrangement is most likely to be
  discovered. For it has been demonstrated in such groups, that the most perfect order and harmony
  will come out, of what appeared an inextricable entanglement of relations. Such, however, will
  never result from the belief in a simple scale of Nature, or by attempting to circumscribe groups
  by absolute characters. We therefore now offer the foregoing sketch of the natural divisions of
  the <i>Nayades</i>, as the result of all we have seen or read upon this difficult subject.</p>

  <p>We are unacquainted with any described species to which the shell here figured can be referred.
  Its substance is very thick, and its form nearly cylindrical. We have seen but one specimen, and
  that was with Mrs. Mawe.</p>

  renders it not liable to be mistaken in a group of birds, presenting in general a great similarity
  of plumage. The upper parts are greyish brown, varied with obscure, dusky, broken lines of
  blackish; each feather being tipt with a small round white spot: wing covers and tertials the
  same: upper and under tail covers ferruginous; each feather with a white spot before the white one
  which is at the tip, lower breast and all the under plumage rufous brown, crossed by black lines;
  the white dots nearly obsolete, tail ferruginous, with about six black bars: legs brown, hind claw
  as long as the tarsus. Fourth and fifth quill longest.</p>

  <p>This genus has been judiciously separated by M. Vieillot from <i>Troglodytes</i> (to which
  belongs our Brown European Wren), on account of its lengthened and generally notched bill: the
  greater prolongation of the hind toe is a further distinction; indicating an affinity with the
  more perfect scansorial Creepers.</p>

  <p>To this group belongs the <i>Myothera obsoleta</i> of Prince Charles Bonaparte. No example of
  that genus, or of <i>Thamnophilus</i> (in their most extended sense), has yet been found north of
  Cuba: their straight, cylindrical, and abruptly-hooked bills, offer a striking contrast to the
  lengthened, compressed, curved, and consequently feeble structure of this part in
  <i>Thriothorus</i> and <i>Troglodytes</i>.</p>

  <p>The popular name of Lories has long been given to those Parrots, peculiar to the continent and
  islands of India, whose brilliant red plumage forms a strong contrast to the green colour which
  generally pervades this family. The southern limits of their distribution do not extend to
  Australia, but much of their general structure is transferred to the Lory-Parrakeets, forming the
  modern genus <i>Trichoglossus</i>; this latter group being diffused over the remaining islands of
  the great Pacific Ocean.</p>

  <p>The Ceram Lory, from being well known, and exhibiting the prominent characters of its tribe, is
  a correct type of the genus. Its length is about eleven inches. The general colour is rich
  scarlet, with the wings and thighs green: the bend of the shoulder, (and sometimes a spot on the
  back,) is yellow. Tail graduated, the lower half of the feathers deep blackish green, glossed with
  blue. Inhabits the Molucca Islands.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the attention recently bestowed in characterizing the groups of this family,
  the most important external peculiarity of <i>Lorius</i> and <i>Trichoglossus</i> has been
  overlooked. In these birds, that part of the roof of the under mandible which projects beyond the
  lower, is generally thin, and always perfectly smooth: a weakness of structure which renders it
  impossible for these parrots to feed upon hard substances; and betrays their frugivorous and
  suctorial nature, by indications perceptible to every one.</p>

  <p>Unlike the true Cuckows, the birds of this genus rear and provide for their young in the
  ordinary manner. The species are numerous in the tropical latitudes of both hemispheres. Two are
  found in North America, which, in their external characters, approach so near to the genuine
  Cuckows, that they barely come within the definition of the present group.</p>

  <p>It frequently happens that species, originally well described, become involved in obscurity by
  compilers. Le Vaillant, who first described this bird, supposed it a variety of his <i>Coucou
  Edolio</i>: but in this he was mistaken; the one being a <i>Cuculus</i>; the other a
  <i>Coccyzus</i>. We should have thought our species might be the <i>Cuculus Afer.</i> of Drs.
  Leach and Latham, had not the former stated his bird to be a <i>variety</i> of Le Vaillant's, and
  figured it as an example of the genus <i>Cuculus</i>. Dr. Latham (Gen. Hist. 3, 290) copies this
  description of <i>C. Afer</i>. (Zool. Mis. 1. p. 31), adds some further characters not seen in our
  bird, and, under the same name, describes what is evidently another species. Lastly, M. Vieillot,
  in his account of the genus <i>Coccyzus</i> (Orn. Ency. Meth. p. 1342), relying on the usual
  accuracy of Le Vaillant&mdash;and never, perhaps, having seen the bird&mdash;omits it altogether.
  To prevent this confusion extending further, and to detach the species from those dubious
  descriptions with which it has been mixed, we have thought it best to record it by the name of its
  first describer.</p>

  <p>Our figure will render a detailed description unnecessary: the wings, although long, are
  rounded; the fifth quill being the longest. The total length is fifteen inches. Inhabits Senegal,
  and the Western Coast of Africa.</p>

  <p>From the genera <i>Turbo</i> and <i>Trochus</i> of modern Conchologists, we have detached all
  those species whose shells are closed by a calcarious operculum; and this group we propose to
  distinguish by the name of <i>Marmarostoma</i>. The species, like the <i>Trochi</i>, properly so
  called, are all of a pearly structure; but their substance is much thicker; the base of the shell
  is slightly produced; the exterior surface is marked either with tubercles, grooves, or elevated
  ridges; and the aperture (from the convexity of the last whorl) forms a circle. If the student
  compares these characters with Trochus Zizyphinus, a common British shell, he will immediately
  perceive the leading differences between the two groups.</p>

  <p>But it is the calcarious nature of the operculum (as indicating an important difference in the
  organization of the animal) which constitutes the primary character of <i>Marmarostoma</i>: the
  particular structure of this appendage varies considerably in the different species: in some its
  outer surface is smooth and convex; and in others variously granulated. In the present shell it is
  marked by three or four deep semicircular grooves; that nearest the middle is the deepest, and
  terminates in an umbilicus. In some specimens, the spines on the principal ridge of the body whorl
  are nearly obsolete; but those which crown the summit appear constant.</p>

  <p>We are indebted to the Rev. Mr. Bulwer, a scientific and arduous Conchologist, for our
  specimens of this new species, purchased by him in a collection sent from Panama.</p>

  <p>Among the shells which formed part of the African Museum, exhibited and finally sold in London
  some few years back, was a single specimen of this new and curious Volute. Worn and battered by
  the friction of the waves, it still retained its colour and markings sufficiently distinct to
  admit of a tolerably accurate delineation. The only part we have ventured to restore is the
  contour of the outer lip, which we have adapted to the lines of growth. The middle figure
  represents the shell in its broken state; and this clearly shews the ascending of the lip towards
  the spire, in the same manner as in V. <i>lapponica</i>.</p>

  <p>The affinities which are suggested by the peculiar structure of this shell, are curious. In its
  general shape, and in the number of its plaits, it is obviously allied to <i>Voluta Nucleus,
  harpa</i>; <i>lyræformis</i>, &amp;c., where the two last plaits of the pillar are very thick, and
  those above either small or evanescent; but from such, our shell differs materially by being quite
  smooth, and in having a short obtuse spire. We do not believe that this part has received much
  injury. The suture is perfect to the very end: further evidence may be drawn from the extreme
  narrowness of the third spiral whorl; a formation which only belongs to papillary spired shells.
  This character, joined with the smoothness and size of the body whorl, shews a closer
  approximation to the Melon shells, than to any other division of the group. Three or four
  intermediate forms are alone wanting to complete the double series.</p>

  <p>Mr. Broderip, who is in possession of this shell, has recently arranged the Lamarkian
  <i>Volutæ</i> into very natural groups; two of which are considered as holding the rank of
  genera.</p>

  <p>The Ring-necked Parrakeets of India, and the Asiatic Islands, are now considered as forming a
  particular genus. The geographic distribution of the group, and the characters of the species,
  have been detailed with much skill and classic erudition, in the Zoological Journal.</p>

  <p>Among the numerous ornithological facts, which the distinguished liberality of MM. Cuvier and
  Geoffroy St. <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Hiliare'.">Hilaire</span> enabled us
  to ascertain, during a course of study at the Royal Museum of Paris, is one that relates to this
  species. Specimens in that noble collection, both from Pondichery and Java, enable us to affirm,
  that the <i>Psittacus Osbeckii</i> and <i>Pondicerianus</i> of authors, are one and the same
  species.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the frequency of this bird in Java, and other parts of India, we are completely

  of that knowledge, which gives such an animating charm to natural history, which manifests the
  provision of the Almighty for all His creatures, which can be known and understood by all, and
  which prompts the heart to contemplation and praise. Is there no one, in all our vast Oriental
  territory, to record something of the feathered inhabitants of the Eastern World? Is there not,
  throughout India, even <i>one</i> of our countrymen, imbued with the spirit of a Wilson, a
  Levaillant, or an Audubon?</p>

  <p>This elegant bird, although mentioned by several writers, is of great rarity. So seldom,
  indeed, is it seen in collections, that we never beheld a specimen prior to our visit to the Royal
  Museum of Paris, where our drawing was made. Buffon's description seems to have been transcribed
  by all succeeding writers; and the only figure hitherto published is that at Plate 724 of the
  Planches Enluminèes.</p>

  <p>The habits of the Swallow tribe are known to every one. Like the Flycatchers, they feed upon
  insects captured on the wing; but these insects are of so small a size, that they are swallowed
  during the flight of the bird. This at once accounts for Swallows not being provided with those
  stiff bristles, for confining the struggles of their prey, which are so essential to the
  Flycatchers. These latter birds frequently feed upon insects much too large to be swallowed at the
  moment of capture; they therefore hold their prey until they again perch, and swallow it when at
  rest.</p>

  <p>The figure is the size of life. Excepting the band on the body, and the spot on the
  thighs&mdash;both of which are snowy white&mdash;the whole plumage is of a deep black, richly
  glossed with dark blue. The first quill is longest, and the tail is deeply forked.</p>

  <p>According to Buffon, this bird is sometimes seen perched on floating trees in the rivers of
  Guiana and Cayenne.</p>

  <p>The principal character of <i>Anodon</i>, rests on the absence of teeth; the <i>A.
  anatinus</i>, common to our rivers and ponds, being taken as the type of the group. But, as Nature
  steps progressively, in her departure from one form, and in her advance to another, so among the
  Anodons we find several shells, which do not strictly exhibit the typical character; and these we
  shall briefly notice.</p>

  <p>In the sketch already given of this group, we have placed the genus <i>Anodon</i> between
  <i>Iridina</i> and <i>Alasmodon</i>. The <i>Iridina nilotica</i> Sow, "has scarcely any appearance
  of crenations along the hinge line," but for this, it consequently would present a simple lamellar
  ridge, extending nearly the length of the shell; such, in short, as is seen in <i>Dipsus
  plicatus</i> (Leach), whose tooth may be so described. By this shell we are led to <i>A.
  rubens</i> Lam. where a lamellar plate, though much shorter, is placed beneath the umbones.
  <i>Iridina Cailliandi</i> perfectly resembles <i>A. rubens</i>, except in being without any
  vestige of this plate. We have now entered among the typical species, where every form occurs
  between a round and an ensiform shape. Leaving these, Nature proceeds to fashion an indistinct
  developement of <i>Alasmodon</i> in the species before us, where that part of the hinge plate,
  immediately beneath the umbones, is somewhat raised, and undulated. In <i>A. rugosus</i> these
  compressed undulations assume more the form of tubercles; and finally, in the <i>Alasmodon
  marginatus</i> of Say, the teeth are sufficiently developed to place that shell in a distinct
  group.</p>

  <p>Our esteemed and accomplished friend, Mrs. Corrie of Birmingham, favoured us with two examples
  of what appears to be a variety of that which we have figured. The substance of both is opake; the
  inside white, tinged with buff, and with scarcely any pearly lustre. Inhabits North America, but
  we know not any precise locality.</p>

  <p>The Conchologist will find a full description of the three Mitras here figured in the Journal
  above mentioned. They are all of singular rarity, more particularly <i>strigata</i> and
  <i>carinata</i>, as of these we have never seen second specimens. <i>M. strigata</i> belongs to
  that group which contains M. <i>melaniana</i>, <i>scutulata,</i> &amp;c. Its country is
  unknown.</p>

  <p>This pretty shell seldom exceeds three-quarters of an inch in length; our figure is
  consequently enlarged: the pillar has four plaits. This, in conjunction with M. <i>casta</i>,
  <i>olivaria</i>, <i>dactylus</i> (Lam.), and <i>olivæformis</i> (Sw.), constitute a particular
  group, allied to <i>Con&#x0153;helix</i>, having the plaits extending far beyond the aperture.</p>

  <p>There are few groups in Conchology, more particularly among the bivalve shells, possessing so
  great a union of delicacy and beauty as the Tellinæ; and perhaps there is none in which the
  species, from their general similarity of shape, and variability of colouring, are so little
  understood. For these reasons, we intend to illustrate this elegant genus very fully.</p>

  <p>The <i>Tellinæ</i> appear to hold a station with the most typical groups of the Bivalve
  Mollusca; or those in which the animal can freely remove, from place to place, by the foot. In all
  such the shells are solid, regular, and not attached to other substances.</p>

  <p>We select the <i>Tellina latirostra</i> of Lamarck for our first subject. As a species it has
  not been figured; while the original description, which we have transcribed, is so slight, that
  some uncertainty exists as to the precise species intended by the writer. That to which we here
  apply the name, is certainly very like, as Lamarck observes, to <i>T. rostrata</i>; although his
  description, in other respects, is applicable to other species now before us. Our <i>Tellina
  latirostra</i> is not common, although we once received a considerable number from Amboyna. Its
  surface is very smooth, but the delicate striæ, which can scarcely be seen by the naked eye,
  become perfectly clear under a common lens. The Manchester Nat. Hist. Society is in possession of
  a lovely series, exhibiting the following variations of colour: 1, pure white; 2, rose-coloured
  round the umbones, paler beyond; 3, entirely rose colour; 4, blush white, with a rosy shade on
  each side the umbones; 5, pale orange; 6, buff yellow, resembling <i>T. depressa</i>. In all these
  the points of the umbones are invariably white.</p>

  <p>The Ground Parrakeets of Australia, of which this is one of the most beautiful, form a small
  but richly coloured group of birds, remarkable for the peculiar structure of their feet, which
  leads them to frequent the ground more than any of their family. In the form of their bill, wings,
  and tail, they exhibit a close resemblance, in miniature, to the Maccaws of the New World, and may
  justly be supposed to represent those birds in the Southern hemisphere.</p>

  <p>We received two specimens of the Blue-fronted Parrakeet, some years ago, from Van Dieman's
  Land; yet even there it is considered scarce; nor did we observe it in any of the collections in
  Paris.</p>

  <p>Assenting, in a great measure, to those general principles of arrangement which several eminent
  Ornithologists have proposed regarding this family, we nevertheless consider that the succession
  of affinities, and even the nature of the leading groups, are not yet correctly understood. In the
  present case, we would rather have seen <i>Nanodes</i> placed as a sub-genus to <i>Pezoporus</i>;
  from which it merely differs in the comparative shortness of the feet. The connexion between the
  two forms, moreover, is so close as not, in our judgment, to admit the intervention of
  <i>Platycercus</i>, or any other group yet discovered.</p>

  <p>The Starlings of the old continent, are represented in America by a tribe of birds formerly
  denominated Orioles, but which we shall distinguish by the name of Hangnests. They are gregarious
  and noisy; living both upon insects, fruits, and grain. Their nests are purse-shaped, woven with
  great dexterity, and generally suspended from the extreme branches of lofty trees.</p>

  <p>Much has been done to illustrate the affinities of these birds, and to define the species; but
  both are imperfectly known. Regarding their natural arrangement, our own views are quite at
  variance with the ingenious theory of Mr. Vigors; and as to the species, the bird before us is a
  curious example of error.</p>

  <p>The true <i>O. <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'caynensis'.">cayanensis</span></i>,
  in the best modern systems, has been lost sight of; and, under the new name of <i>chrysopterus</i>
  (Vieil. Wagler.), has been confounded with <i>three</i> others, one of which is a
  <i>Xanthornus</i>, one an <i>Icterus</i>, and one an <i>Agelaius</i>! The only authentic synonyms,
  which can therefore be consulted for our bird, are those we have quoted.</p>

  <p><i>Cassicus</i>, <i>Cassiculus</i>, <i>Xanthornus</i>, and <i>Icterus</i> are the only
  published genera which will come within our definition of the <i>Icterinæ</i>.</p>

  <p>The Ant Thrushes, as originally defined by us, constitute a natural group of Birds peculiar to,
  and very abundant in, the tropical regions of the New World. They are found only in the deep
  shades of forests, seeking their nourishment on the ground, from ants and other terrestrial
  insects. Beyond such retreats they never venture, and thus their natural love for seclusion has
  prevented us from knowing more of their economy.</p>

  <p>The species are numerous: our own cabinet contains fifteen: but nearly double that number are
  among the rich and surpassing treasures of the Royal Museum at Paris. Of that here figured, we
  have never seen a second specimen.</p>

  <p>In the form of the bill, and the elongated lax plumage of the back, <i>Drymophila</i> bears a
  close resemblance to the smaller species of Bush Shrikes (<i>Thamnophilus</i>), but the
  construction of the feet&mdash;adapted in one for perching, and in the other for
  walking&mdash;will sufficiently distinguish these groups.</p>

  <p>The specific name of <i>grallaria</i>, engraved on the plate, was inadvertently changed for
  that of <i>longipes</i> in the published account. The figure represents the natural size.</p>

  singular bivalve shells forming the order <i>Brachiopoda</i> of Mr. Macleay. The valves have
  neither teeth or ligament, but are united by muscles, and supported on a fleshy peduncle, three or
  four inches in length, by which the animal is attached to marine bodies.</p>

  <p>We believe that under the common name of <i>Anatina</i>, two species have been included. Their
  respective peculiarities were published, some time ago, in the Journal above alluded to; and are
  now more fully illustrated by figures, and by such specific distinctions as are exhibited by the
  shells. Both species appear to inhabit the Indian Ocean.</p>

  <p>Greatly allied to the Ground Parrakeets of Australia, but differing from them in many
  particulars, are the Broad-tailed Parrakeets of the same region, forming the modern group
  <i>Platycercus</i>. The former appear to represent the Maccaws; while the latter exhibit many
  strong points of analogy to the Lories; but we question if their resemblance extends further.</p>

  <p>We have had one of these beautiful Parrakeets in our possession, alive, for many years. Its
  manners are gentle and timid. Like many of its congeners, it delights to wash itself in a basin of
  water. In the day, and during winter, it is generally silent; but on a mild evening it will go on,
  for two or three hours, with a somewhat whistling note; sometimes shrill, but generally soft and
  pleasing. Its ordinary diet is moistened bread, with a little hemp and canary seed; but during
  summer and autumn the small garden fruits appear to be highly welcome to our elegant little
  favourite.</p>

  <p>Our figure represents a variety of the male bird, wherein the light green on the scapular
  feathers is wanting. The total length is about sixteen inches.</p>

  <p>We consider the primary divisions of the <i>Psittacidæ</i>, are those which have long been
  recognized under the familiar names of Maccaws, Cockatoos, Parrots, Lories, and Parrakeets. Such a
  series is the result of a synthetical investigation we have given to the subject; but this mode of
  inquiry is so deceptive, and has led to so many erroneous conclusions, that until each of these
  groups are submitted to a patient analysis, which has never yet been done, no correct opinion on
  the subject can be formed. The name on the Plate (engraved five years ago) is a mistake. The first
  description and figure of this bird is in "White's Voyage to New South Wales," where it is
  described as not uncommon.</p>

  <p>We found this remarkable bird not uncommon in the thick Forests of Pitanga, near Bahia, during
  our travels in Brazil in the years 1815-7. Yet although the male birds were frequent, we were
  never fortunate enough to procure a female. It has likewise been found in the southern provinces
  of that empire, by Dr. Langsdorff.</p>

  <p>Its total length is about seven inches; the whole plumage, with the exception of the snowy
  bands on the wings, is intensely black: the white spot on the back is only seen when the feathers
  are raised: the irides, in the live bird, are of a beautiful crimson.</p>

  <p>My friend M. Lesson, conjectures truly in thinking, that the birds placed by M. Temminck in our
  genus <i>Drymophila</i>, have no connexion or analogy with those species we have described, or
  with the characters on which we originally founded the group: they belong, in short, to a
  different family.</p>

  <p>The splendid little birds arranged under this group belong exclusively to Tropical America.
  They are generally seen in pairs, frequenting open woody tracts; feed principally upon fruits, and
  seldom if ever perch upon the ground: In the variety, and richness of their colours, they are only
  surpassed by the Humming Birds.</p>

  <p>The Red-headed Tanager has never, we believe, been found in Brazil; although it occurs in
  Cayenne, Surinam, and some of the West India Islands. Buffon was its first describer; he informs
  us that in French Guyana it appears in small flocks, two or three times in a year; arriving when
  the fruit of a particular tree is ripe, and departing when it begins to fail. Some specimens are
  more brilliant than others, originating probably from age or locality: those from Cayenne are
  known by a delicate blue tinge on the breast. A further variety has been described (<i>Ency.
  Meth.</i>), in which the upper part of the neck is also red, and the back marked by a large spot
  of dull rufous (<i>brun-marron</i>). We suspect this will prove a distinct species. The rank of
  this group, whether as generic or subgeneric, can only be determined by analyzing the whole
  family.</p>

  <p>This is a genus of fresh water shells, particularly abundant in Africa, Asia, and America; we
  have also heard it has lately been detected in Europe.</p>

  <p>We should not have figured this common and well known shell, but for the purpose of comparing
  it with the next. When in a young state, the spines are very acute: more advanced they become less
  so; and in old individuals they are often very obtuse.</p>

  <p>This is a most singular species. From the tubular spines emerge two or three hornlike, elastic
  bristles, which appear embedded in the substance of the shell. A very ample account of the first
  specimen we ever met with, will be found in Brand's Journal for April, 1824. It was discovered in
  the Isle of France, by Mr. Warwick, where it appears to be very rare. Other specimens have since
  been brought to this country.</p>

  <p>We were unwillingly drawn into a controversy respecting this shell some years ago. Our
  sentiments, in every thing that regards the shell itself, are unchanged. Not so with respect to
  the individual. The civilities and attentions we have since received from Mr. Gray, leave us to
  regret, very sincerely, that such a discussion should have ever taken place.</p>

  white. The <i>M. adusta</i> of Lamark is, in short, the same as the <i>ruffina</i> of Linnæus: or
  at least that species which Dr. Solander and Mr. Dillwyn conceive to be such. Our shell is from
  the Isle of France, and is not common: the crenated teeth on the lip are very strong; the base
  obtuse, and effuse: the spire and aperture of equal length.</p>

  <p>The buff-coloured yellow which spreads over the upper plumage of this bird, in some lights
  becomes much richer, and delicately gilded. The wings appear to be sea-green, but this colour only
  margins the borders of the feathers, the inner parts of which are blackish: the tail is coloured
  in the same way, the feathers divaricating from the middle, which is slightly forked. The black in
  front terminates at the vent; which, with the sides of the body, are waxen yellow.</p>

  <p>In the Ornithology of M. Vieillot, we find no mention of this well known bird by its long
  established name: but the <i>T. chloroptera</i> of this writer, described as a new species, is
  evidently no other than the <i>flava</i> of anterior authors.</p>

  <p>Our figure is of the natural size. The female is dark bluish green above, and buff beneath,
  much paler on the throat and breast: the chin and sides of the head blackish; and the crown
  buff-coloured yellow.</p>

  <p>To describe in detail those colours and markings of an insect, which the eye can embrace at a
  single glance on a well executed representation, is surely unnecessary. We shall therefore merely
  observe that this species has hitherto remained unfigured: that it is a native of Southern Brazil,
  and of such rarity, that in two years, we never met with more than one specimen.</p>

  <p>In some observations upon what appear to us the leading groups of the <i>Diurnal
  Lepidoptera</i>, published some time ago, we considered those groups wherein the anterior feet are
  perfectly developed, and the chrysalis braced by a transverse thread, as the most perfect and
  typical. Subsequent observations confirm us in this general view; but it still remains to be
  investigated, to which group the generic name of <i>Papilio</i> should be retained. The wide
  dispersion of that form represented in the two European species <i>Podalirius</i> and
  <i>Machaon</i>, and which form occurs in all the temperate and tropical regions of the globe,
  leads us to suspect it as the most typical group: to this, <i>Papilio Niamus</i>, from its very
  close affinity to <i>Podalirius</i>, unquestionably belongs.</p>

  <p>This is one of the rarest and most splendid lepidopterous insects of Brazil. We were once
  fortunate in capturing six specimens, fluttering over a shrub in the early morning sun, during our
  encampment in the Forest of Urupeè, in the Province of Bahia: but we never again met with this
  charming creature.</p>

  <p>The perfect insect has been figured in the costly, but truly valuable, work of Cramer; yet as
  neither the larva or pupa are known, we cannot determine on its natural group. Its relations, as
  suggested by the perfect insect, appear to be these. We consider the analogy between the groups
  respectively containing <i>P. Podalirius</i>, and <i>Marius</i> (Cr.), to be immediate and direct:
  the form of the last type, and much of its general structure, is seen in our insect; but the
  details will not admit of a further similitude. Among the <i>Ericinæ</i> we again detect this form
  in <i>P. Corineus</i> and <i>Dorylus</i> (Cr.), and continuing the comparison, we see the
  <i>antennæ</i>, <i>palpi</i>, and feet (in one sex) of <i>Rhetus</i>, accurately represented in
  those of <i>P. imperialis</i> (Cr.), among the <i>Thecladæ</i>. We therefore suspect, that the
  real affinities of our insect lie between the two last groups: It seems moreover to have a strong
  analogy with <i>Leilus</i>. The upper figure is of the male, the under of the female.</p>

  <p>This elegantly formed shell is a native of the Red and Indian Seas. It is the most common of
  the few species retained in the genus <i>Rostellaria</i>; all these are recent; while
  <i>Hippochrenes</i> has occured only in a fossil state.</p>

  <p>The preceding table of affinities, connecting the leading forms among the <i>Strombii</i>, will
  be adverted to hereafter. At present we shall offer a few observations on the nature of that more
  comprehensive division of the class <i>Mollusca</i>, to which this particular group appears to
  belong.</p>

  <p>The learned Author of the Horæ Entomologicæ, in that part of his valuable essay relating to the
  <i>Molluscæ</i>, considers our knowledge of these animals too imperfect to enable him to state the
  nature of the typical groups: the situations of which, in his diagram of the animal kingdom, are
  therefore merely indicated by stars. M. Macleay further remarks, that the <i>Gasteropoda</i> of M.
  Cuvier, with certain restrictions, evidently form a circular group. Yet, from the above omission,
  it appears he still entertained some doubts on the propriety of this arrangement. Labouring under
  similar disadvantages to those which impeded the researches of so profound an observer, we feel
  some hesitation in expressing a different sentiment on the subject, particularly in reference to
  his own disposition of affinities.</p>

  <p>It is evident that these typical groups, whatever may be their nature, must present some very
  strong points of analogy to those in the circle of <i>Vertebrata</i>: and that such analogies
  should extend to the corresponding groups of the <i>Annulosa</i>. This we should expect, not only
  as the necessary result of a truly natural arrangement, but as a primary test, by which the
  correctness of any series of affinities must be tried. Now admitting that Quadrupeds and Birds
  shew the same typical perfection among the <i>Vertebrata</i>, as the Mandibulate and Suctorial
  Insects unquestionably do in the <i>Annulosa</i>, we have two beautiful analogies between these
  otherwise dissimilar groups, taken from one of the most important functions of nature. Quadrupeds
  and mandibulate insects are provided with jaws for tearing and masticating their prey, while in
  birds and suctorial insects, the mouth is lengthened into a proboscis, by which nourishment is
  imbibed by suction. These analogies are equally conspicuous among the <i>Molluscæ</i>. The
  <i>Phytiphages</i> of Lamarck (of which the garden snail is a good example), are furnished with
  jaws and masticate their food: the <i>Zoophages</i> of the same accurate observer, have their
  mouth elongated into a retractile trunk or proboscis, by which they pierce through other shells,
  and suck the juices of the inhabitant. To insist on the importance of these distinctions, employed
  as they have been to characterize primary divisions, is surely unnecessary. That they will be
  subject to considerable modification, in the subordinate groups, may naturally be expected: but we
  refrain at present from offering an opinion on the nature of such groups, dependant, as they must
  be, on greater anatomical knowledge than we yet possess. Nevertheless, until more direct analogies
  are discovered, than those here stated, we feel some confidence in employing them as
  <i>typical</i> distinctions of the two great divisions of <i>Gastropod Mollusca</i>.</p>

  <p>In a small collection of birds, from the interior of the vast Empire of Brazil, we met with
  this new and highly interesting species. Its resemblance to the well known <i>Psaris Cayanus</i>
  is so close, that even Ornithologists would not at first suspect the difference; and this may
  possibly account for its having been overlooked. The size and colour of the two birds, in fact,
  are perfectly alike: but in this, the bill is much more depressed; the orbits, instead of being
  naked, are covered with feathers: and the spurious intermediate quill is entirely wanting. Our
  bird thus presents not only the characters of a species, but a modification of form, leading to
  the genus <i>Pachyrhynchus</i> of Spix.</p>

  <p>Our friend Sir William Jardine, Bart., who has long felt, with us, a peculiar interest in this
  group, will accept our dedication of this species to him, as a proof of the estimation in which we
  hold his studies.</p>

  <p>The publication of <i>Psaris Cuvierii</i> in the early series of our work, was the first
  addition made to this group after its publication in the <i>Regnè Animal</i>. The generic name of
  <i>Psaris</i> soon after became familiar to British Ornithologists, by being universally adopted.
  Recently, however, the Editor of the Zoological Journal has expressed his opinion that this name,
  on the score of priority, should give place to another. The question would be of little moment did
  it merely concern this group; but involving, as it does, the entire nomenclature of two systems,
  it becomes a matter of some importance to ascertain their respective claims. The period of
  typographic publication, as connected with the only process by which knowledge can be universally
  communicated, is the only criterion, in our opinion, by which such claims should be decided.
  Dates, if <i>truly affixed</i>, speak for themselves. But to attain this advantage, no
  surreptitious or disreputable practices can be allowed. A plausible claim may indeed be made by
  any author, who hastily puts together an essay or pamphlet, for the sole purpose of anticipating
  the patient labours of another: but such artifices, when discovered, are sure to be
  discountenanced by honourable minds. To illustrate our meaning better, we will state a case.</p>

  <p>Let us suppose, then, a learned Naturalist, in charge of a public museum, is engaged in a
  general classification of the animal kingdom: that to the type of each group, as progressively
  defined, he affixes a label, with the proposed name, and returns it again to the public rooms. Let
  us further suppose that an Ornithologist, wishing to make a new system, but without any materials
  for so doing, goes to this museum, selects, as they are successively named, these identical types
  for his examination, well knowing by whom, and for what purpose they are so named. He then goes
  home, and publishes, with all expedition, an ill-digested pamphlet, <i>wherein every group appears
  under a name, totally different from that by which he became acquainted with it</i>.</p>

  <p>It is not for us to make the application. But that such practices have been resorted to, is
  well known among the highest scientific authorities in Paris. It is not so much in justice to a
  distinguished individual, as our respect for the broad principles of truth and honour, that we
  have said thus much. These are grave charges, but they are not lightly brought forward. Resting,
  as they do, on testimony the most unquestionable, we should deem it almost insulting to our
  countrymen could we suppose they will henceforward, by adopting these names, countenance a claim
  built on such a fraudulent basis.</p>

  <p>Our views of the natural situation of this group, must be reserved for the next number.</p>

  <p>The analagous resemblances between the species and groups of one region, and those by which
  they are represented in another, are among the most curious and remarkable facts in Natural
  History: whether we look to them as proofs of a Divine plan, vast in its extent, and wonderful in
  its details, or as exemplifying that system of symbolical relationship by which every part of the
  animated world is mutually connected. Both appear intended for one great purpose, the partial
  initiation of man into earthly mysteries, that he may have greater faith in those which regard his
  eternal welfare.</p>

  <p>The Robin, spread over the whole of Europe, is represented in temperate America by the Blue
  Bird of Wilson (<i>Sialia Wilsonii</i>, Sw.). Neither of these are found in New Holland, but the
  bird before us may be considered their representative. Lewin, who wrote upon the spot, observes
  that although in some respects solitary, it frequents the abodes of man <i>in winter</i>, like the
  Robin; which it further resembles in its note. Our European bird is intimately connected with the
  Stonechats (<i>Saxicolæ</i>).&mdash;The remark of another eye witness, proves the Australian
  species to have the same relation. Mr. Caley mentions that he saw "this bird in November" (<i>our
  European summer</i>), "when far distant in the mountains, in the roughest part of the country I
  had then or since visited." <i>Linn. Tr. 15. p. 245</i>. Mr. Caley, moreover, as if perfectly
  aware of its natural affinities, names it the Australian Redstart. So closely, in short, does this
  bird resemble our European Stonechat, that but for the recent acquisition of more typical species,
  we should have had doubts whether to characterize it as a distinct type.</p>

  <p>Linnæan writers, as might be supposed, have always regarded this as a Flycatcher, but as Mess.
  Horsfield and Vigors have recently dwelt, at some length, on the propriety of such an arrangement,
  it may be as well to state the leading differences between the two families. In <i>Muscicapa
  atricapilla</i>, (with which these gentlemen have compared our bird,) the bill (fig. 1, 2), like
  that of every genuine Flycatcher, is depressed from the base to the tip, while that of
  <i>Petroica</i> (fig. 5, 6), of the <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'Sonechat'.">Stonechat</span> (fig. 3, 4), and of all <i>Saxicolæ</i>,
  although depressed at the base, is invariably <i>compressed</i> on the sides. By these characters
  the former preserve their affinity to the Todies, and the latter to the Thrushes. In the garnature
  of the rictus there is also an essential difference. The bristles of the <i>Muscicapæ</i> (f. 1,
  2), are always rigid and directed forwards: while those of the <i>Saxicolæ</i>, although sometimes
  remarkably long, are generally weak, and diverge in different directions. Thus much may be stated
  on the chief peculiarities of the groups in question: they may for the present be termed
  analogies, but there are considerations which induce us to suspect they are more intimately
  connected by affinity than is generally supposed. To facilitate comparison, our figure is of the
  natural size, and particular care has been taken in the correct delineation of all the proportions
  and details.</p>

  <p>The Weaving Birds, confined to the hotter regions of the old world, are chiefly found in
  Africa, where they represent the Hangnests (<i>Icterinæ</i>) of America: an analogy long since
  remarked by Buffon. Both these tribes astonish us by the consummate skill with which they
  fabricate their nests: but the intelligence displayed by the African Weavers is still more
  wonderful. The curious reader will see a most interesting account of these birds in Paterson's
  African Travels, or in Wood's Zoography.</p>

  <p>Of the present species, although very common in Senegal, nothing appears known beyond the
  simple fact of its weaving, in confinement, between the wires of its cage. Its total length is
  about six inches, the minor proportions may be correctly ascertained by the scale on the
  plate.</p>

  <p>If the genus <i>Ploceus</i> of Baron Cuvier be restricted to the old world, it becomes one of
  the most natural groups in Ornithology. Yet, like all others of an extensive nature, it exhibits
  several modifications of structure, which the present state of science renders it necessary to
  define. Whether such definitions are to be termed generic, subgeneric, or sectional, must, in the
  first instance, depend on mere opinion. It is enough if these lesser groups are defined. To
  ascertain their relative value is the next step: this is the second, and by far the most difficult
  process, in the study of real affinities; for not only that particular group which claims our
  attention, but every other related to it in a higher division, must be patiently analyzed. Hence
  it frequently results that groups assume a very different <i>apparent</i> station to what they did
  in the first instance. Are we therefore to refrain from characterizing or naming them, because
  their relative value cannot, in the first instance, be ascertained? We think not. That
  <i>genera</i> have been unnecessarily multiplied, no one can doubt, who has looked beyond such
  circumscribed limits. And if forms of transision, (generally comprising one or two species alone,)
  are to be so ranked, we must immediately treble or quadruple the present number of ornithological
  genera. The truth is, that many groups, which in our first process of combination, we are obliged
  to distinguish, or perhaps name, will, in the second, be united to others. So that it appears
  highly probable that the number of genera, in ornithology, ultimately retained, will be fewer
  perhaps than at present. We are, in short, but in the infancy of this knowledge, and our genera,
  for the most part, must be looked upon as temporary landmarks, to denote the ground gone over, and
  to be fixed or removed as our views become more extended, by a wider analysis of qualities and
  relations.</p>

  <p>The politeness of Mr. G. Sowerby has given us the opportunity of examining this rare and little
  known species, first described and <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'acurately'.">accurately</span> figured by himself. It was discovered, we
  believe, by Mr. Cranch, the ill-fated naturalist who accompanied the unfortunate expedition to the
  Congo, in that river. No specimens, we are informed, have subsequently reached this country. The
  surface is rough, occasioned by irregular corrugated wrinkles: the epidermis olive.</p>

  <p>The shell from which our figure was taken we received from Mr. G. Sowerby, under the name of
  <i>Nilotica</i>, some years ago. Whether it is the same, or specifically distinct from Lamarck's
  <i>Guinaica</i>, we have no means of judging, otherwise than from the figures he cites of
  Chemnitz. If these are accurate, there are many points of difference; but no doubt the Editor of
  the <i>Bulletin des Sciences</i>, will have great pleasure in setting us right upon this
  subject.</p>

  <p>On attentively comparing the descriptions, given by Lamarck, of eleven species of
  <i>Ampullaria</i>, with those we have characterized in different works, we can only discover two
  instances wherein the same species have been mentioned by both parties, under different names. Our
  <i>A. conica</i>, is probably Lamarck's <i>virens</i>, and belongs to the genus <i>Pachystoma</i>,
  Guild. The other instance is curious; in the Appendix to the Bligh Collection, we described a
  remarkable variety of <i>A. fasciata</i>, under the sub-specific name of <i>Canaliculata</i>. In
  the following month appeared the second part of Lamarck's <i>Système</i>, wherein this variety
  appeared as a <i>species</i>, under the very same name. It would almost appear as if the two
  accounts had been written at the same moment. We have since had good reason to be confirmed in our
  suspicion as to this shell being a mere variety of <i>fasciata</i>, from a fine series of
  specimens sent us from Demerara. We take this opportunity, however, of expressing a belief that
  our <i>A. leucostoma</i>, is the young shell of <i>rugosa</i>.</p>

  <p>In our last number we defined what appear to be the leading forms among the <i>Strombii</i>,
  from such characters as are exhibited by their shells. This mode of classification, we admit, is
  always attended with hazard; and should not be ventured upon without due precaution. To attempt a
  <i>natural</i> arrangement of the higher groups, on such considerations alone, would be manifestly
  absurd. On the other hand, we think both principles may be carried too far: and that a system
  founded exclusively upon the animal would, in our present state of knowledge, be little less
  artificial than another taken merely from the shell. We see, on every side, throughout Nature, the
  most beautiful and perfect adaptation of structure to use. The typical <i>Mollusca</i>, whether
  among the <i>Acephala</i> or <i>Gasteropoda</i>, appear to be testaceous; and to exhibit a
  corresponding perfection in the structure of their coverings: one form passes into another by as
  gradual modifications of the shell, as could possibly be looked for in the nature of the animal.
  We have attempted to exemplify this among the <i>Unionidæ</i> and the <i>Olivæ</i>. We shall now
  examine the <i>Strombii</i> with reference to the same object.</p>

  <p>"<i>Les Aileés</i>," observes Lamarck, "<i>constituent une famille très-naturelle, qui avoisine
  celle des Canaliferès par ses rapports, mais qui en est éminemment distincte</i>." This able
  classifier (whose perception of affinities is truly admirable), then proceeds to divide these
  shells into three groups, founded upon such excellent distinctions, that we need not here dilate
  on their importance. Two of these genera are characterized by a deep and well defined sinus or
  notch, towards the base of the outer lip; quite distinct from the basal canal, and intended either
  for the passage of the animal's proboscis, or its <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'respitory'.">respiratory</span> siphon. In <i>Strombus</i> the outer lip is
  dilated, but entire; in <i>Pteroceras</i>, it is equally enlarged, but divided into long
  processes. Such are the typical distinctions, and their immediate union appears effected by the
  <i>Strombus laciniatus</i> of Chemnitz. The third genus of Lamarck's is <i>Rostellaria</i>, in
  which he places all those species wherein the sinus above mentioned is united to the basal canal.
  Now if the <i>Strombus pespelecani</i> of authors had this canal more closed, and the sinus
  distinct, it would be a <i>Pteroceras</i>. Da Costa long ago placed this shell as the type of a
  genus, and the observations of Mr. Dillwyn, in his short but highly valuable paper on fossil
  shells (Phil. Trans. for 1823, p. 1, p. 393), have shewed the importance which we should attach to
  its structure: it is, in fact, a <i>Pteroceras</i>, but with the above mentioned sinus removed to
  the base of the digitated lip, and confounded, as it were, with the basal canal. Excepting to a
  <i>Pteroceras</i>, it cannot be compared with any known shell, unless it be to the <i>Strombus
  fissus</i> of Linn. The hiatus between them certainly appears great, yet the affinity is not
  interrupted by any thing known: this latter shell resembles the true <i>Rostellariæ</i>, but with
  the digitated processes of <i>Pteroceras</i> reduced to teeth; which teeth, in <i>R.
  curvirostris</i>, become confined to the basal part of the unexpanded lip. We are here met by
  certain fossil shells, preserving the form of <i>Rostellaria</i>, but with the outer lip entire,
  and sometimes considerably expanded: in these the spiral canal sometimes extends to the summit of
  the shell: finally the distinct sinus again appears in such species as <i>S. cancellatus</i>,
  <i>canalus</i>, &amp;c., all which have been classed by conchologists with <i>Strombus</i>. This
  series is sufficient to shew the <i>tendency</i> of a circular disposition of relations, but very
  many of the intermediate forms are wanting, nor is it at all clear in what way the immediate
  passage is effected between <i>Hippochrenes</i> and the genuine <i>Strombii</i>.</p>

  <p>We are indebted to the Rev. Mr. Bulwar for our specimens of this elegant and highly interesting
  species, received by him from the American Isthmus. It varies much in the intensity of its colour,
  as may be seen from the above description, given by Lamarck, of examples procured by Baron Humbolt
  on the shores of Mexico.</p>

  <p>There are reasons for believing the genus <i>Voluta</i>, as defined by Lamarck, to be typical
  of a natural group, comprising the genera <i>Mitra</i>, <i>Oliva</i>, <i>Ancillaria</i> and
  <i>Marginella</i>. The obvious affinity between <i>Voluta</i> and <i>Mitra</i> need not be dwelt
  upon. The connexion of <i>Mitra</i> with <i>Oliva</i>, we noticed in describing <i>Mitra
  olivæformis</i>, at pl. 48 of our first series. This affinity appears further strengthened by a
  shell in the late Tankerville Collection, especially recorded by Mr. G. Sowerby, as "remarkable
  for its resemblance to an Olive." We regret not having seen this shell, but such an authority is
  fully sufficient. The group of Mitres, by which this transision appears effected, is that
  mentioned under the head of <i>M. bicolor</i> (Mitra, Pl. 1.) of this series. This little group
  has three relations: one to the smooth Mitres (as <i>M. pertusa</i>), another to <i>Conohelix</i>,
  and a third to the <i>Olives</i>: the species are all remarkable for the polished smoothness of
  their surface, for the total absence of the inner lip, and for the lower plaits of the pillar
  extending much beyond the aperture: these plaits, moreover, are generally five or six, and all
  very slender. The conchologist will perceive that nearly the only character wanting, to render
  this description applicable to an Olive, is the channelled groove round the suture. This character
  is added to the shell before us, which thus presents the first type of form in the present genus.
  Proceeding to the more perfect Olives, we observe the spire becoming gradually shorter; the
  vitrious deposition on the inner lip increased in thickness; the upper plaits on the pillar
  numerous, and those at the base thicker and more external (<i>M. fulmineus</i>, Lam.
  <i>elegans</i>, En. Meth. 362, 3.), the ventricose shape of some (<i>O. undata</i>,
  <i>inflata</i>, Lam.), the spire often concealed by a vitrious covering, and even the colours of
  others (<i>M. tessellata</i>, <i>guttata</i>) remind us of the typical Volutes. It is very
  remarkable, that in most of the cylindrical Olives, the apex is more or less, papillary: the last
  complete terminal volution of the spire being thick, inflated, and distorted: (see particularly
  <i>O. reticularis</i>, En. Meth. 36, f. 1; <i>fusiformis</i>, Ib. 367, 1; <i>guttata</i>, Ib. 368,
  f. 2.) Others are seen of a more slender form, as <i>O. subulata</i>, L. <i>acuminata</i>, E. M.
  368, 3, where the pillar is similarly plaited. But in several small species allied to <i>O.
  conoidalis</i>, another modification of form has evidently commenced: the spire is regularly
  acute; the upper plaits disappear; and those which remain, are only at the thickened base of the
  pillar: the aperture, no longer narrow, becomes wide at the base, where the pillar takes an
  oblique direction inward: we are thus led to the form of <i>O. hiatula</i>, E. M. pl. 368, f. 5,
  where the characters of <i>Ancillaria</i> become apparent in the effuseness of the mouth, the
  double belt at the base, and the imperfect groove on the outer side of the pillar. Whether we look
  to this shell, or to the descriptions given by Lamarck of the fossil species <i>plicaria</i>,
  <i>canalifera</i>, and <i>laumontiana</i>, or finally, to the <i>Ancillaria glandiformis</i>, Sow.
  no doubt can remain of the genus <i>Oliva</i> being here blended with the <i>Ancillariæ</i>. There
  is, however, another form among the <i>Olivæ</i>, which deserves mention, as it cannot well be
  associated with either of the preceding: this we have described below. Another genus that may be
  thought connected with <i>Oliva</i>, is <i>Terebellum</i>: a group very ably illustrated by Mr. G.
  Sowerby, in his "Genera of Shells." To that work we must refer the reader for those reasons which
  shew its more immediate relation to <i>Ovula</i>. It is, in short, one of those forms too
  hazardous to class without a complete knowledge of the animal.</p>

  <p>Of this very rare species we know but of two specimens, both of which appear to have come from
  the mining provinces of Brazil. The economy of these interesting birds has not yet been detected,
  even by naturalists who have lived in their native regions. The indefatigable Azara professes his
  ignorance on this point, but states some valuable information on a species (nearly allied to the
  <i>Cayenne Saris</i>) named by him <i>Le Distingué a tête Noir</i>, which, in Paraguay, is a bird
  of passage: its flight is elevated, rapid, and prolonged. "<i>Ils ne sont ni farouches, ni
  remuans, et ils se tiennent long temps à la même place. Ils ne sortent point des grands bois, et
  ils se perchent toujours au plus haut des arbres les plus èlevés, où ils ne cherchent pas à se
  cacher.</i>" Azara Voy. 3, p. 407.</p>

  <p>The size and strength of the bill induced us, some years ago, to adopt the popular
  classification of this genus with the family of Shrikes; but a more particular analysis of that
  and the neighbouring families, lead us to suspect that its natural situation is far different: our
  reasons for this belief will be stated at large in another work. For the present it may be
  remarked, that the smoothness of the rictus, as indicating a frugivorous habit, forbids us to
  place it with the Flycatchers; while the feet, perfectly different from those of the true Shrikes
  (<i>Laniana</i>, Sw.), can only be compared with those of the <i>Piauhau</i> (Buff.). The affinity
  which this group bears to <i>Gubernetes</i>, is merely superficial: but its analogies to
  <i>Ceblepyris</i>, among the <i>Laniadæ</i>, and to <i>Pachycephala</i>, among the
  <i>Ampelidæ</i>, are probably direct.</p>

  <p>The merit of having first directed the attention of Ornithologists to the singular spurious
  quill, which generally distinguishes the males of this group, we transfer from ourselves to Azara.
  His invaluable work we did not then possess, and knew not that the circumstance had already been
  mentioned by him.</p>

  <p>We are only acquainted with the genus <i>Pachyrhynchus</i> of Spix, by seeing this name affixed
  to our <i>Psaris Cuvierii</i> in the Paris Museum. The distinction is judicious; particularly as
  the two groups point to different relations. Of <i>Psaris</i>, as now restricted, we know of six
  species, and of <i>Pachyrhynchus</i>, ten.</p>

  <p>Our present bird is osculent between these forms: we place it with <i>Psaris</i> on account of
  its wings and tail; but it accords with <i>Pachyrynchus</i> in the rictus being slightly bristled.
  The spurious quill is half the length of the first, which latter is as long as the fourth. The
  tail is in a slight degree rounded. It is, perhaps, needless to remark, that all these birds are
  confined to Equinoctial America.</p>

  <p>For an inspection of this new and imposing species, we have to thank Mr. Ward, an Animal
  preserver of considerable talent. We do not find it mentioned in any Ornithological work we
  possess, and our library is not small: but with so many publications continually issuing from the
  continental press, we shall feel no surprise at discovering it has already been published.</p>

  <p>This and the <i>Hirundo albicollis</i>, (first named by M. Vieillot) are two of the largest
  species yet discovered, of a very singular group of Swifts; wherein the tail feathers are spined,
  and even more rigid than those of the Woodpeckers: by this structure the birds can remain for a
  considerable time in the most perpendicular situations. The expanded tail thus acts as a powerful
  support, which is further increased by the size and strength of the claws, much larger than those
  of ordinary Swallows. There are several species, most of which are natives of America.</p>

  <p>The direct analogy which this group bears to the typical scansorial Birds, joined to the
  general superiority of flight which the Swift possesses over the Swallow, leads us to suspect this
  may prove to be the typical group of the <i>Fissirostres</i>; an order in which Nature, in her
  wish to develope the greatest powers of flight, appears to neglect all those laws which she
  afterwards so rigidly adheres to: We intend in another work, to enter on this interesting subject
  more fully.</p>

  <p>In giving publicity to this new and interesting bird, we feel particular pleasure in expressing
  our thanks to Allen Cunningham, Esq., His Majesty's Botanist, in New South Wales, by whom it was
  there discovered. Although devoted to a science already so much benefited by his researches, this
  enthusiastic Traveller found some leasure for Ornithology, and has lately favoured us with a large
  collection of skins, prepared during one of his inland journeys; with a request that they may be
  made public: among other highly curious forms, the present bird is conspicuous. It was found in
  the open forest country, North of Liverpool Plains.</p>

  <p>When once we are so fortunate as to discover the natural station of any being, we may be
  convinced that every circumstance regarding its structure, habits, or even colour, are employed by
  Nature to typify its relations to other beings; and that until most of these can be explained,
  there is good reason to suspect the accuracy of our views on its true affinities. Possessing all
  the essential characteristics of <i>Petroica</i>, our bird exhibits in the bill, feet, and tail,
  an immediate affinity to <i>Sialia arctica</i>: while it is clothed in the pure white, and glossy
  black plumage, which nature afterwards employs to designate the typical group of <span
  class="sc">Gryllivora</span>, (North. Zool.) at the opposite point of the circle of
  <i>Saxicolinæ</i>. This remarkable analogy is extended to the bill, the point of which is longer
  and more incurved, than in any of the immediate affinities of our bird: its close relation to the
  old world <i>Saxicolæ</i>, is too obvious to need explanation.</p>

  <p>In <i>Voluta</i> and <i>Mitra</i>, the two typical groups of this family, the variations of
  form are so striking, and the species so numerous, that we readily assent to the plan, proposed by
  others, of further dividing them into genera: but in the aberrant group, containing <i>Oliva</i>,
  <i>Ancillaria</i>, and <i>Marginella</i>, the forms are less diversified, and the species fewer;
  the minor divisions may therefore, for the present, be termed sub-genera. The approximation of
  <i>Marginella</i> to <i>Voluta</i> has frequently been stated. In M. <i>bullata</i> we have a
  miniature melon Volute, while M. <i>faba</i> is a no less obvious representation of V.
  <i>magnifica</i>. Hence these forms appear typical. Yet M. <i>persicula</i> and <i>lineata</i>
  cannot well be placed with either, as their characters seem to indicate a direct analogy to
  <i>Conohelix</i> among the Mitres. As to <i>Volvaria</i>, we concur with other writers, in

  <p>Cramer describes this elegant Butterfly as a native of Surinam, and our own specimens were
  received from the same country. All the species of this group that have yet fallen under our
  inspection, are natives of South America. Their flight is high, powerful and rapid: the
  predominating colour on the upper surface of their wings is brown, and on the under white.</p>

  <p>It is the misfortune of not understanding the typical structure, and the principles which
  regulate its variation, in higher groups, that in defining the characters of a lesser, we can form
  no just idea of its relative value: whether, in short, we should consider it a genus or a sub
  genus, or whether it is typical, aberrant, or osculent. This, however, is but a temporary evil;
  and will only continue until an insight is gained into higher combinations, by first placing
  together kindred species under one common name. If this be done heedfully, such a group
  <i>must</i> be natural, whatever opinions may be entertained in the <i>first</i> instance, as to
  its proper denomination.</p>
